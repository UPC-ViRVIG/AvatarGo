**AvatarGo** is a Unity package for incorporating **self-avatars** in any **Virtual Reality** application with a low-cost set-up consisting of a **SteamVR-based HMD, 2 Controllers and 3 HTC VIVE Trackers**. It incorporates a custom calibration step in which users need to walk inside a virtual avatar. Using a custom Fingers Inverse Kinematics solution, the hands can automatically adjust to the controllers.
