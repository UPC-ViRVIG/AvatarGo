**AvatarGo** is a Unity package for incorporating **self-avatars** in any **Virtual Reality** application with a low-cost set-up consisting of a **SteamVR-based HMD, 2 Controllers and 3 HTC VIVE Trackers**. It incorporates a custom calibration step in which users need to walk inside a virtual avatar. Using a custom Fingers Inverse Kinematics solution, the hands can automatically adjust to the controllers.

## Troubleshooting FAQ
**Q: The project cannot be opened because Unity warns that there are errors to be solved:**

Some dependencies might not be installed yet. Press continue and open the project, then follow the installation instructions to add all dependencies.

**Q: The mirror is not displaying any text:**

Probably the TMP Essential Resources are not imported. Go to: 'Window/TextMeshPro/Import TMP Essential Resources' and import all files.

**Q: I can only see the mirror with one eye:**

Go to 'Edit/Project Settings/OpenVR' and change 'Stereo Rendering Mode' from 'Single Pass Instanced' to 'Multi Pass'.
